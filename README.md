This is a simple **Higher-Lower** game where the user selects which of two given choices has a **higher Instagram follower count**. 
The game continues in a streak-based format, and your score increases as long as you keep selecting the correct option. 
If you select a choice with **fewer followers**, the game ends.

## How to Play
